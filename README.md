## Design Inspiration

When I planned to create this project, I dicided to use Ukrainian national rushnyk and kalyna on the table as a background. After this I picked up the colours for text and content.

### Colour Scheme

As a main colours, I used ```white``` colour for my text and ```rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.518)``` for block background to make content more readable.

Colour Blind Safe and contrast was checked by [Adobe Color](<https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility>)

### Font

Using [Google Font](<https://fonts.google.com/>), I imported "Montserrat" and "Bricolage Grotesque" to my CSS file. I set "Montserrat" as my default font. I used "Bricolage Grotesque" as a font for content on my menu page and for authorisation pages.

# Features 

Detailing the existing and planned features and the value they bring.

## Existing Features

 __The Background Image__

- Presents a rushnyk - traditional Ukrainian cloth that serves both practical and ceremonial purposes. The term originates from the Ukrainian word "ruka," meaning "hand," and while it can refer to an ordinary towel, it is more commonly associated with ritualistic uses in cultural ceremonies across Ukraine.
![Background image](static/media/bg.webp)

 __The Logo Image__

- I designed an app for restaurants featuring a striking logo that showcases a stylized fork and spoon crossed beneath a chef's hat. The design is rendered in bold black and red colors for a visually appealing and memorable look. Also this logo used as a Favicon for the page. 
![Logo image](static/media/logo-text.webp)

 __Contact section__

- On the main page, the user can find the contact section with phone number and email. When you click on email, it will automatically redirect you to the mailbox for writing an email to the restaurant. Also, users can find the map with the restaurant's location on it.
![Contact section](docs/features/contact-section.webp)

 __Navbar Menu__

- For better user experience, navigation links are located to right side of the navbar. I used white transparent background and black text to separate it from the other content. Also, I added logo image and the name of the restaurant to the left side of navbar on every page, despite main pages.
![Navbar on main page desktop view](docs/features/navbar-desktop-main.webp)
![Navbar on desktop view](docs/features/navbar-not-main.webp)
- For the small devices I added burger menu and logo with the name of the restaurant to the every page. Also, links are located to the right sight.
![Navbar burger menu](docs/features/mobile-navbar.webp)

__Logged in/logged out user message__

- The user will be informed whether they are logged in or not.
![Message](docs/features/message-login:out.webp)

__Booking Model__

- This reservation system enables users to easily book a table for evening dining. Key features include:
Guest Capacity: Choose from a limited selection of party sizes.
Time Slots: Select from a few predefined evening time options.
User-Friendly: Simplified choices streamline the booking process.
This model enhances customer convenience while helping restaurants manage reservations effectively. 
![Time choices](docs/features/times.webp)
![Guest choices](docs/features/guests.webp)
![Booking Model](docs/features/booking.webp)

__Toast Messages__

- When you interact with the website, you'll receive toast messages that inform you about the success or failure of your actions. Whether youâ€™re making a booking, registering, logging in or out, or adding a review, these notifications will provide immediate feedback on your activities. 
![Booking success](docs/features/booking-toast-msg.webp)
![Toast message](docs/features/toast-messages.webp)

__Menu Page__

- On the menu page, you can explore detailed information about the dishes offered by the restaurant, organized into distinct sections for an enhanced user experience. One notable feature of the menu items is the use of logo images as placeholders, which are displayed when a specific dish image is not available.
![Menu page](docs/features/menu-page.webp)
![Menu image placeholder](docs/features/menu-img-placeholder.webp)

__Review Page__

- On this page, you can read reviews and leave your own if you are logged in. Additionally, you have the option to edit or delete your own reviews. 
![Review](docs/features/review-view.webp)
![Write review](docs/features/write-review.webp)

-  If you choose to delete your review, a confirmation message will appear to verify your decision before proceeding.
![Delete confirm](docs/features/delete-alert.webp)

- If you decide to edit your review, you will be redirected to a separate page featuring the review form. There is also an option to cancel your changes if you change your mind.
![Edit page](docs/features/edit-page.webp)


__Authorisation__

- Users can register, log in, and log out. Once authorized, they can access features such as making reservations and submitting reviews.
![Sign Up](docs/features/registerform.webp)
![Log In](docs/features/login.webp)
![Log Out](docs/features/signout.webp)
![Authorized user](docs/features/write-review-anchor.webp)
![Non-authorized user](docs/features/not-login-book.webp)
![Non-authorized user](docs/features/not-login-review.webp)


__The Footer__ 

- The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites of Hata na Tata restaurant. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user. 
- The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
![Footer](docs/features/footer.webp)



## Features Left to Implement

- In the future, I plan to include an About page. Additionally, I would like to enhance the booking form by adding a validator to manage limited table availability. 
- For the contact section, I aim to implement a form that allows users to send emails directly from the website without needing to open their mailbox.

# Database Schema - Entity Relationship Diagram

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) for Hata na Tata showcases the connections between users, reviews, and bookings. It also highlights that only admin or staff users have the privilege to add content to the menu page. 
This diagram is crucial in visualizing the relationships among various models within the PostgreSQL database.

![ERD](docs/testing/graphviz.webp)

The above ERD was generated using Python Extension - pygraphviz and pydotplus. 
Documentation at (<https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/graph_models.html>).

# Agile Methodologies - Project Management

I used my [Github Projects Board](<https://github.com/users/Anka-S/projects/5>) to plan and document all of my work, initially I started with a [Trello](<https://trello.com/b/bRIJ6HZd/hata-na-tata-project>) board to allow myself to make some mistakes and gather any scraps of notes or information that I had and then refined them into my Projects board. I'm sure the next time around will be a smoother process.

## MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for Freefido, identifying and labelling my:

 - __Must Haves:__ the 'required', critical components of the project. Completing my 'Must Haves' helped me to reach the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project early, allowing me to develop the project further than originally planned.

 - __Should Haves:__ the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.

 - __Could Haves:__ these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.

 - __Won't Haves:__ the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.

# Deployment

## Connecting to GitHub  

To begin this project from scratch, you must first create a new GitHub repository using the [Code Institute's Template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/ci-full-template). This template provides the relevant tools to get you started. To use this template:

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) or create a new account.
2. Navigate to the above CI Full Template.
3. Click '**Use this template**' -> '**Create a new repository**'.
4. Choose a new repository name and click '**Create repository from template**'.
5. In your new repository space, click the purple CodeAnywhere (if this is your IDE of choice) button to generate a new workspace.

## Django Project Setup

1. Install Django and supporting libraries: 
   
- ```pip3 install 'django<4' gunicorn```
- ```pip3 install dj_database_url psycopg2```
- ```pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage```  
  
2. Once you have installed any relevant dependencies or libraries, such as the ones listed above, it is important to create a **requirements.txt** file and add all installed libraries to it with the ```pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt``` command in the terminal.  
3. Create a new Django project in the terminal ```django-admin startproject hatanatata .```
4. Create a new app eg. ```python3 mangage.py startapp review```
5. Add this to list of **INSTALLED_APPS** in **settings.py** - 'booking',
6. Create a superuser for the project to allow Admin access and enter credentials: ```python3 manage.py createsuperuser```
7. Migrate the changes with commands: ```python3 manage.py migrate```
8. An **env.py** file must be created to store all protected data such as the **DATABASE_URL** and **SECRET_KEY**. These may be called upon in your project's **settings.py** file along with your Database configurations. The **env.py** file must be added to your **gitignore** file so that your important, protected information is not pushed to public viewing on GitHub. For adding to **env.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```os.environ["DATABASE_URL"]="<copiedURL>"```
- ```os.environ["SECRET_KEY"]="my_super^secret@key"```

For adding to **settings.py**:

- ```import os```
- ```import dj_database_url```
- ```if os.path.exists("env.py"):```
- ```import env```
- ```SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('SECRET_KEY')``` (actual key hidden within env.py)  

9. Replace **DATABASES** with:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get("DATABASE_URL"))
  }
```

10. Set up the templates directory in **settings.py**:
- Under ``BASE_DIR`` enter ``TEMPLATES_DIR = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, â€˜templatesâ€™)``
- Update ``TEMPLATES = 'DIRS': [TEMPLATES_DIR]`` with:

```
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates'),
os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'templates', 'allauth')
```

- Create the media, static and templates directories in top level of project file in IDE workspace.

11. A **Procfile** must be created within the project repo for Heroku deployment with the following placed within it: ```web: gunicorn freefido.wsgi```
12. Make the necessary migrations again.

## Cloudinary API 

Cloudinary provides a cloud hosting solution for media storage. All users uploaded images in the FreeFid project are hosted here.

Set up a new account at [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) and add your Cloudinary API environment variable to your **env.py** and Heroku Config Vars.
In your project workspace: 

- Add Cloudinary libraries to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py 
- In the order: 
```
   'cloudinary_storage',  
   'django.contrib.staticfiles',  
   'cloudinary',
```
- Add to **env.py** and link up with **settings.py**: ```os.environ["CLOUDINARY_URL"]="cloudinary://...."``` 
- Set Cloudinary as storage for media and static files in settings.py:
- ```STATIC_URL = '/static/'```
```
  STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.StaticHashedCloudinaryStorage'  
  STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'), ]  
  STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')â€Œ  
  MEDIA_URL = '/media/'  
  DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'cloudinary_storage.storage.MediaCloudinaryStorage'
```
## Heroku deployment

To start the deployment process , please follow the below steps:

1. Log in to [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/login) or create an account if you are a new user.
2. Once logged in, in the Heroku Dashboard, navigate to the '**New**' button in the top, right corner, and select '**Create New App**'.
3. Enter an app name and choose your region. Click '**Create App**'. 
4. In the Deploy tab, click on the '**Settings**', reach the '**Config Vars**' section and click on '**Reveal Config Vars**'. Here you will enter KEY:VALUE pairs for the app to run successfully. The KEY:VALUE pairs that you will need are your: 
   
   - **CLOUDINARY_URL**: **cloudinary://....** 
   - **DATABASE_URL**:**postgres://...** 
   - **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC** of value '1' (N.B Remove this Config Var before deployment),
   -  **PORT**:**8000**
   -  **SECRET_KEY** and value  
  
5. Add the Heroku host name into **ALLOWED_HOSTS** in your projects **settings.py file** -> ```['herokuappname', â€˜localhostâ€™, â€˜8000 port urlâ€™].```
6. Once you are sure that you have set up the required files including your requirements.txt and Procfile, you have ensured that **DEBUG=False**, save your project, add the files, commit for initial deployment and push the data to GitHub.
7. Go to the '**Deploy**' tab and choose GitHub as the Deployment method.
8. Search for the repository name, select the branch that you would like to build from, and connect it via the '**Connect**' button.
9.  Choose from '**Automatic**' or '**Manual**' deployment options, I chose the 'Manual' deployment method. Click '**Deploy Branch**'.
10. Once the waiting period for the app to build has finished, click the '**View**' link to bring you to your newly deployed site. If you receive any errors, Heroku will display a reason in the app build log for you to investigate. **DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC**  may be removed from the Config Vars once you have saved and pushed an image within your project, as can **PORT:8000**.
