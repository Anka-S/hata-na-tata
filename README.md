## Design Inspiration

When I planned to create this project, I dicided to use Ukrainian national rushnyk and kalyna on the table as a background. After this I picked up the colours for text and content.

### Colour Scheme

As a main colours, I used ```white``` colour for my text and ```rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.518)``` for block background to make content more readable.

Colour Blind Safe and contrast was checked by [Adobe Color](<https://color.adobe.com/create/color-accessibility>)

### Font

Using [Google Font](<https://fonts.google.com/>), I imported "Montserrat" and "Bricolage Grotesque" to my CSS file. I set "Montserrat" as my default font. I used "Bricolage Grotesque" as a font for content on my menu page and for authorisation pages.

# Features 

Detailing the existing and planned features and the value they bring.

## Existing Features

 __The Background Image__

- Presents a rushnyk - traditional Ukrainian cloth that serves both practical and ceremonial purposes. The term originates from the Ukrainian word "ruka," meaning "hand," and while it can refer to an ordinary towel, it is more commonly associated with ritualistic uses in cultural ceremonies across Ukraine.
![Background image](static/media/bg.webp)

 __The Logo Image__

- I designed an app for restaurants featuring a striking logo that showcases a stylized fork and spoon crossed beneath a chef's hat. The design is rendered in bold black and red colors for a visually appealing and memorable look. Also this logo used as a Favicon for the page. 
![Logo image](static/media/logo-text.webp)

 __Contact section__

- On the main page, the user can find the contact section with phone number and email. When you click on email, it will automatically redirect you to the mailbox for writing an email to the restaurant. Also, users can find the map with the restaurant's location on it.
![Contact section](docs/features/contact-section.webp)

 __Navbar Menu__

- For better user experience, navigation links are located to right side of the navbar. I used white transparent background and black text to separate it from the other content. Also, I added logo image and the name of the restaurant to the left side of navbar on every page, despite main pages.
![Navbar on main page desktop view](docs/features/navbar-desktop-main.webp)
![Navbar on desktop view](docs/features/navbar-not-main.webp)
- For the small devices I added burger menu and logo with the name of the restaurant to the every page. Also, links are located to the right sight.

__Logged in/logged out user message__

- The user will be informed whether they are logged in or not.

- This reservation system enables users to easily book a table for evening dining. Key features include:
Guest Capacity: Choose from a limited selection of party sizes.
Time Slots: Select from a few predefined evening time options.
User-Friendly: Simplified choices streamline the booking process.
This model enhances customer convenience while helping restaurants manage reservations effectively.

__Toast Messages__

__Menu Page__

- On the menu page, you can explore detailed information about the dishes offered by the restaurant, organized into distinct sections for an enhanced user experience. One notable feature of the menu items is the use of logo images as placeholders, which are displayed when a specific dish image is not available.

- The footer is valuable to the user as it encourages them to keep connected via social media
![Footer](docs/features/footer.webp)



## Features Left to Implement

- In the future, I plan to include an About page. Additionally, I would like to enhance the booking form by adding a validator to manage limited table availability. 
- For the contact section, I aim to implement a form that allows users to send emails directly from the website without needing to open their mailbox.
